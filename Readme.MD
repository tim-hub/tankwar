## Why Design This
Please see my [blog](https://tim.bai.uno)

In summary, this is a battle city clone. But it is not finished.

Programmed by monodevelop ide, and using monogame/xna.

## Notices
- The pictures files are not included in this repo. So maybe you need to add and include them (eagle, cube tank, etc) in 40x40 pixels by yourself.
